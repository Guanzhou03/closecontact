# Introduction

Hello! We are Alvin Jiang and Chen Guanzhou, developers of Close Contact, an android friend-finding app, and this is our readme, which also serves as a documentation to why and how we came to undertake this project. Throughout this document, you will understand why we believe our project is meaningful and the motivation behind it.

We will also elaborate on the features that we have decided to implement, providing a program flow to understand how our app is structured. After which, we detailed the various Software Engineering Principles we have adopted, followed by the project log to detail the time each of us have spent over the course of this project.

# Motivation 

As students facing the challenges of interacting with others amidst the COVID-19 situation, we find it difficult to get to know others, and increase our social circle.

Many students find themselves craving social interaction with others, with high levels of loneliness reported in college students[^1]. An idea of a social networking app, made for students, can increase one's exposure to others such that they can make more friends.

# Aim 

We hope to create a social app that University students can make use of to find other students of the same course/hobbies/activities that they are keen on. Using a matchmaking system, we can allow students to swipe through the profiles of others, and chat with those they are interested in.

The app will serve to improve and enhance social interactions by providing a platform that allows for social interaction between students. This promotes more social activity within NUS students which has been painfully lacking, especially in recent years.

# User Stories

1.  As a student, I want to be able to customize my profile to include my course, hobbies, activities that I am looking to do with others.

2.  As a student, I want to be able to message other users on the app.

3.  As a student, I want to be able to look at the profiles of other users of the app, and swipe right or left depending on whether I am interested in interacting with them.

4.  As a student, I want to be able to see when others request to chat with me, and accept or decline accordingly.

5.  As a student, I want to be able to report others who abuse the platform, and send messages to the administrator.

6.  As an administrator, I want to be able to receive feedback from users regarding the platform and respond to messages sent by users.

# Features and Timeline

**As we update on our readme over the course of the project, we will have decided to make use of this section to review our goals over the Milestones.**

## Features to be completed by Milestone 2: 

1.  Creating and Customizing Profile

    a.  Users can select their course of study, interested activities, hobbies, from a given list, which will be displayed on their profile. ✅

    b.  Users can upload and display a profile picture. ✅

    c.  Users can write a short biography about themselves, which will be displayed on their profile. ✅

2.  Messaging System

    a.  Allow users to message other users. ✅

    b.  Allow users to send messages to the administrator. ✅

        i.  Completed as of Milestone 3

3.  Request Handling System

    a.  ~~Allow users to see their sent requests~~ ❎

        i.  We have since decided to remove this feature, as we do not think the benefits it brings is significant enough to justify the work necessary, and it also does not negatively affect any of our user stories.

    b.  Allow users to see their incoming requests, and accept or decline accordingly. ✅

4.  Matchmaking System

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  Swiping system allows users to connect with others, swiping right automatically sends the other party a chat request, which can be accepted by the other party. Swiping left will allow the user to skip the current profile. ✅

## Features to be completed by Milestone 3: 

1.  Allows users to filter out profiles with certain characteristics (eg Course/Gender). ✅

2.  Implement a feedback system for users to report bugs, other users. ✅

3.  Mechanisms to collect datasets for analysis. ❎

    a.  For this portion, we were unable to explore mechanisms to collect datasets, although firebase console provides an easy way for us to look at the data within the database.

4.  **Improve on current core features to increase options for users (new).**

    a.  **Swipe System to allow users to swipe once on every other user only.** ✅

    b.  **Messaging System to allow sending of images, videos etc.** ✅

    c.  **Profile Page to allow for greater customization.**✅

5.  **Improve on current User interface to increase intuitiveness for users. (new)** ✅

6.  **Implement an algorithm that recommends profiles based on "similarity" (new)** ✅

7.  **Improve current testing methods. (new)** ✅

    a.  While we made some small improvements, we did not deviate much from our testing techniques as implemented in Milestone 2. This will be further elaborated upon under the Quality Assurance Section.

8.  User verification system to prevent misuse. ✅

    a.  Already implemented in Milestone 2

**Possible extensions on our app in the future:**

Looking beyond Milestone 3, we could potentially explore these following features, although it is not a priority at this stage of development.

-   Data on profiles which are swiped left/right by the user can also be stored to provide even better recommendations to enhance user experience using data analysis.

-   Extend beyond NUS into university students in Singapore/students in general

-   We would like to further explore administrator versions of the application, which we have ideated upon but did not have the time to implement.

**How are we different from other platforms?**

1.  **Social media platforms (Instagram/Facebook/Twitter)**

> Our platform focuses on allowing NUS students to make friends and connections with other NUS students. Social media platforms do not narrow down the demographic to NUS students specifically, and it is much easier to make friends and connections with our product than with these social media platforms.

2.  **Matchmaking/Dating platforms(Tinder/Bumble)**

> Our platform provides a safe environment for students to interact and make connections with other students. The students must be verified by their NUS email and are not anonymous and users can report any offences/offenders through the app and they will be directed to the relevant authorities. Other matchmaking apps like Tinder may not be as safe, and are not limited to just students so it may be harder for our users to make connections with people that are similar to them. (NUS students looking for NUS students to befriend/date)

3.  **Social applications targeted at NUS Students (NUS Chat Bot)**

> Although these applications target NUS/University students in general, they do not contain details about the user such as their hobbies and interests. There are also no avenues for them to share photos of themselves, compared to our app. Matchmaking is also done on a random basis and not based on direct chat requests. Our app shows interests and details of a user so interested users can reach out and make friends with them.

# Project Scope

This section of the readme covers the login and authentication process, key functionality of the application and extensions that can enhance user experience.

**Authentication** - User registration and login with verification using NUS email address.

**Key functionality** - Core features including home page, profile page, and chats page

**Extensions** - Users can filter profiles, use a feedback system/report system, allow users to upload images/other media, and make use of a user recommendation system.

Reset password page

### Home page

After logging in, users will be brought to the home page where they can see other profiles, and users will be able to swipe left/right for each profile they see, until there are no more profiles left. Swiping right sends a chat request to the other user while swiping left skips the user.![][9]

> Sample home page profile

### 

### 

###  Profile page

Users can navigate to their profile page to update their profile information. Users must provide their information so that they can participate in swiping and other app activities. Users with an incomplete profile (missing information in My Profile page) cannot swipe right on other users.

![][10]

> Sample profile page

### 

###  Chats Page

Users can also navigate in the navigation bar at the bottom to the chats page, where their current chats are. A chat room is created and shown in this page once the user accepts a chat request from another user, or another user accepts the current user's chat request. They can tap into their current chat to view chat messages and continue chatting.

![][11]

Sample chats page of current chats

### Chat Requests Page

From the Chats Page, users can tap into the chat requests page on the top right of the Chats Page screen. Here, the users can see all incoming chat requests from other users. Users can tap into the profile avatar to see information about the user sending the chat request. In the chat requests page, users can swipe right to accept the chat request or swipe left to dismiss the request. ![][12]

![][13]

## 

## Milestone 3: Extensions, optimizations and improvements to existing features to improve user experience and usability.

###  Chat Requests Improvements

Users will now be able to make the decision to accept or decline incoming chat requests

after tapping into the incoming user's profile info, using intuitive accept or decline buttons. This is an improvement as feedback has been given regarding the unintuitive swiping in the chat request page previously as users did not know they had to swipe.

![][15]![][16]

**→**![][17]

**Tap on profile**

###  Profile page improvements

There are now more fields for user to provide their information so other users can get to know them better. Gender, area/location, and more interests have been added. Should users not want to share these information, we have also added an option for them to choose not to reveal their information. There are also improvements in text alignment.

![][18]![][19]

Choose Interests Added gender and area fields

###  Set user preferences and filter out profiles

Users can now set their preferences in the filter profile page, and only filtered profiles will be shown in the home page. Users can select any number of preferences, including everything which will show all available profiles. If no profile matches the preferences, the home page will show no profiles.

![][20]![][21]

> **→**

Profile page Set your preferences

###  Recommendation algorithm implementation

We have implemented a recommendation algorithm, where profiles that users may be more likely to be interested in are shown first in the home page. We use a simple interests-matching algorithm to calculate the similarity score between the interests of any two users. We sort the list of profiles on the stack using this similarity score, to allow profiles with similar interests to the user be shown first, enhancing the user experience.

For example, if user X matches all my interests listed in my profile, then user X will have the highest similarity score and will appear first for me to swipe in the home page. This will be particularly useful especially then the number of profiles increases.

Example: The profile with 3 out of 4 similar interests (highest among all profiles) appears first.

![][22]![][23]

###  Image uploading feature

On top of the text messaging feature we implemented previously, we have implemented an image uploading feature. Users can choose an image from their device and send it.![][24]

Image sent using the upload button on the left

###  Report user feature

We have implemented a report user feature where users can report other users that they are chatting with. For example, if someone is suffering from harassment, they can report the user to the admin and explain the issue to the admin. The admin will be notified and are able to report these perpetrators to the relevant authorities if necessary,

![][25]![][26]

**→**

After tapping top-right menu After report, chat with admin

###  Block/unblock user feature

Users can block/unblock other users. Blocked users will not be able to send messages

![][27]![][28]

**→**

After tapping top-right menu Alert appears to inform user

###  Feedback/report bugs feature

Users can report any bugs/problems with the app or any feedback in general using the report a bug button in the home page.

![][31]![][32]

**→**

Report/feedback on top right Submit feedback form

###  Delete chat feature

Users are able to delete chats by touching and holding a chat until an alert pops up that allows them to delete the chat. This will help to smoothen their user experience. For example, if a user has been reported to the admin and the issue has been solved, they can delete and close the chat with the admin.![][33]

# Challenges Faced

## Future-proofing of Code

Throughout our journey during orbital, we implemented many different features, that all build upon the previous features. Because of this, we had to make sure that the code we write is future proof, such that our **future features do not break or cause our previous features to break.** In addition, it proves difficult to change any data structures that we have chosen previously to store our information. An example of this would be our Multi-Select Form Field, to store lists of interests.

Changing the implementation for this particular widget was challenging, as **many other widgets depend on this widget and it required a List\<String\> to work**. This made it difficult to change the implementation of an interest selector during Milestone 3, even though we received feedback that users would like to key in their own interests.

![][35]

Multi-select Form Field

## Asynchronous Programming

We realised the importance of asynchronous programming. Throughout the software development, we ran into **many issues that would have been easily solved with a good understanding of asynchronous programming**. We had to learn the syntax in Dart, and learning how to make use of asynchronous calls to assist us. This was difficult as many of our widgets required some sort of asynchronous programming. In this same respect, **Firebase methods are all asynchronous calls as well**.

With a mastery of this, we were able to create widgets that are well integrated with the firebase backend. An **example of this is the swipe card, which builds a list using a series of asynchronous snapshots**.

## Real time updates 

We managed to implement most of the features without too much difficulty, however **implementing it with real time updates was much more difficult**. For example, when a user is in a chat and the other user decides to block the current user, the blocked user must immediately be unable to send messages without the need to refresh or re-render the chats page. If not, the purpose of the block feature would be much less meaningful if the user did not want to receive any more messages immediately. We **used a listener for this problem to listen to state changes and update the block status accordingly**.

Other less important but still good to have examples include **real time updates for when a chat request is sent while the user is on the chat requests page, or when a user accepts your chat request when you are on the chats home page**. Without the user deliberately refreshing or re-rendering the page, it was a challenge to implement the features that work in real time.

## Implementation of specific features

The implementation of specific features, particularly the swipe card feature and the chatting feature, which are core features of our app, were extremely difficult for us due to the **complexity of the features and the lack of any prior development experience** with Dart in our team.

The chatting feature was incredibly complex because there are many parts to it and we must be very clear about each part. We had to **implement a message model, database methods for reading and writing data, and plan on the organisation and storage of the messages and chat rooms in Firestore, while handling messages sent with real-time updates for both users, as well as the correct ordering and frontend display of the chat messages.**

The swipe feature was very challenging because it was a **key component that was required very early** and had to be implemented before the chatting feature. It was complex as it **consisted of gesture detection of swiping and it is the only place in our app where animations are used when users swipe left or right**. The action also sends a chat request to the other user so backend support was required to organise the information. Later on, we also had to make it such that swiped users do not appear again and users are also ordered based on the similarity of their interests, as well as filtered profiles to improve the user experience.

# 

# Bugs Squashed

This section covers the bugs we have encountered during the implementation of the features above, and how we managed to squash them.

## Chatting feature timestamp

In the database, the messages in a chat room are ordered chronologically, so that we are able to display the latest message first and the chat page has the correct order of messages shown as expected in a chatting feature. However, the way we retrieve the timestamp is using the user's device time, and we **noticed not all users have the same accurate time on their devices**. This also affects users from other timezones, and causes messages to be ordered incorrectly (for example new messages shown on top instead of at the bottom of the chat).

In order to squash this bug, we **made use of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) package, which is able to get the precise time from NTP. We use the NTP to get the offset from the current device time to the real precise time**, and simply add the offset to the device time to get the real time. In this way, all messages sent will be standardised to precise time from NTP. The following shows the code implementation in Dart:

![][36]

## Block/unblock users

The way we implemented the block user feature is to find the chat room that the user initiated the block in, and block out the chat room so that no messages can be sent by either user once a block has been initiated. However, **this resulted in the blocked user being able to unblock the chat and send messages, which is not intended**.

To solve this, we created an initiator field in the database for each chat room on top of the isBlocked field, and **if there is an initiator that is not the current user, the current user will not be able to unblock the chat**. Once unblocked, the initiator field becomes empty and either user can block again.

After we solved this bug, we noticed that the blocking does not work in **real time chat when the blocked user stays on the chat page since there is no re-rendering of the chats page**. Therefore we do not retrieve the updated blocked status from the database. The blocked user is still able to send messages if he stays on the chats page without refreshing. To solve this issue, we added a listener to assign the block state correctly in real time so that blocking will immediately take effect even when the blocked user stays on the page. The following shows the code implementation in Dart:

![][37]

The listener that was added in order to enact real time changes

## Swiping and chat requests

There is a bug where there can be **multiple chat requests from the same user**, because the card stack does not keep track of the profiles that the current user has already swiped on. To fix this bug, we created a list of profiles in the database that each user has seen and swiped on, so that there will not be repeated swiping on the same profiles.

![][38]

The list of seen users

## Added interests causing overflow

In the home page, we display each user's interests on their profile card. With the addition of more interests to accommodate more user interests, there is **a possibility of overflow if all interests are selected** which causes the profile card to allocate a huge amount of space to place all the interests. We simply decided to limit the number of interests shown in the home page to improve the user interface. We only show the first 4 interests on the home page, but their full interests can still be seen in their profile info by the user they have swiped right on.

![][39]![][40]

Overflow due to too many interests

## Automated Testing 

When writing our test cases for automated testing, we encountered difficulty in getting tests cases to run correctly, and it would almost always return in failure, with the screen turning black before it loads the next screen correctly, even though testing it manually would demonstrate that our app does, indeed, work as intended. This was puzzling to us and it was difficult to tell whether it was an error in the test cases that were written or it was a bug in our program. **Our initial diagnosis was that the package we used was unable to track navigations made by the user, however, this was proven false once we did more research and looked at more online guides**.

After some time of trying out methods in the package, we realised that by implementing a manual gap of a few seconds, the test almost always passes and the dialog we anticipated will load correctly. This bug was extremely elusive as there were not much signs we had to accurately diagnose the origin of the bug, and **due to us always carrying out manual testing, we did not account for the time required for backend processes to take place before seeing the dialog.** However, when the machine input the fields automatically, there was a noticeable pause before the dialog is shown, and without the few seconds gap, the WidgetTester had already determined that it had failed.

![][41]

The necessary line of code for the test case to pass.

The above are just 5 of the bugs that we were able to catch and fix by Milestone 3. Through this, we also realised the **importance of writing good code**, and communicating in the event where we needed to debug each other's code. Furthermore, we learnt the **importance of version control**, to ensure that our main branch is always stable.

# Program Flow

**[Activity Diagram]{.underline}**

![][42]

The above diagram seeks to provide a brief overview of the interactions between the components of our app.

Upon opening the app, the user is able to login/register with the assistance of Firebase Auth. After successfully logging in, the user will be able to see a **Home Page, with a swiping system**, and also includes **navigation to other screens including a Profile Page and Chat Screen**.

The **Home Page** has a Swipe System that **allows the user to swipe left or right** on the other users registered on the application. After each swipe, the swipe card is then removed from the stack. This is the **key feature that allows chat requests to be sent to other users**.

The **Profile Page** has fields that the user can edit, including a p**rofile photo, a biography box, lists for interests, year as well as faculty** to select from. This information can then be saved and updated accordingly.

The **Chat Page** has a list of all the chats that the current user is in, either due to an outgoing request being accepted, or accepting an incoming request. **Clicking a particular chat will bring them to a messaging screen**, where users are able to send messages to each other. The chat page **also supports navigation to the Chat Requests Screen**, where all incoming requests are displayed. Accepting this request will add the respective user as a Close Contact and will show up in the Chat Page.

**[Flutter Frontend Widget Tree Diagram]{.underline}**

![][43]

The above diagram is a Flutter Frontend Widget Tree, which shows in detail all the Flutter widgets that we have made use of during the development of our application. The frontend components shown here are a **mixture of Flutter widgets and screens that we have created by using existing packages or lower level built-in widgets**.

In particular, note that the central component that the application is built upon is the "Persistent bottom navigation bar", which acts as a central piece that brings all other screens and widgets together.

For simplicity and clarity, we have chosen to omit low level widgets such as Text, Buttons, Scaffold etc, and instead seek to convey the general structure of our frontend layout.

**[Cloud Firestore Backend Tree Diagram]{.underline}**

![][44]As for our backend, we have opted for a **document store, noSQL database** known as Cloud Firestore. This database makes use of collections, which can store documents, which can then contain information as fields, or even sub-collections.

We have exported our collections as JSON due to their similar data structures, and with the help of a JSON tree visualizer, we have generated a tree that contains all the documents under the "users" collection. The above is an example of one of the user documents within Cloud Firestore.

The root node, **"data", represents the root collection "users"**, and a line connects between it and a **user document, which contains the various fields**. Below it, **sub-collections are represented with "\_collections\_"** and it contains a document "requests", with a field "incoming".

Through the above diagrams and explanations, we hope that readers are able to gain some insight on how we coded both the frontend and backend components, and how they work together to function.

# Quality Assurance

Before implementing new features, we carried out regular testing to ensure that existing features continue to work well, and that new features added integrate well with existing features. This is mostly done in the form of **system testing**, **automated user interface testing** as well as **user testing**.

## System testing: Smoke Tests, followed by Regression Tests

A set of smoke test cases have been selected from a greater list of regression test cases. The objective of these smoke tests are to ensure that major features are not broken according to the user stories it is intended to achieve.

After smoke tests have been passed, we will carry out the full set of regression tests, to ensure that the entire system works in its entirety after implementing the new features.

## Automated User Interface Testing:

Flutter SDK provides developers with tools that can help them conduct testing for their applications. One example of this is the **Integration Test** package. This package allows us to write test cases for the machine to run, thus automating our testing processes. Due to limited time constraints, and a heavy focus put into developing our core features, **we were only able to explore using this Testing technique for basic features, including Login, Register, and Password Reset.**

A detailed explanation of how this test was conducted can be found in the following Test Demo Video: [[Testing Demo.mp4]{.underline}][47]

Unfortunately, after conducting these automated tests, **we realised that while this tool has great potential, making use of it to test a social app such as ours is a non-trivial endeavour**. For example, it will prove difficult to verify that our filter system or recommendation algorithm is working by making use of Flutter's Integration Test package, which can be automated. With the addition of the time spent trying to fix bugs related to this test procedure (which did not add value to our product), we decided to abandon this idea.

## User Testing:

Due to our product being a social app in nature, we also believe that user testing is essential to ensuring that the application is viable and in good working condition for users.

We recruited several of our personal friends to try out a version of the application that has **passed our system testing and automated testing**. We gave them minimal instructions, to simulate the new user experience, and to gauge the intuitiveness of our application. They tried out each of the features implemented for Milestone 2, and consequently gave their rating (out of 10) on the various aspects of our application. The average results collected, as well as the general feedback are as such:

[Main Features and their limitations]{.underline}

-   Profile Customization: 7

    -   Limited list of interests, and unable to enter unique interests as text.

    -   Unable to select no interests

    -   Could include gender, whether the user is living on campus, major, NUS CCAs etc

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Swipe System: 7

    -   After every login, the same swipe card reappears regardless of whether the user has been swiped on previously.

-   Request Handling: 6

    -   Swiping left and right on a chat request is unintuitive, and would prefer to have an accept/decline button

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Messaging System: 7

    -   Messages would be bugged when one of the users involved in the chats are in a different time-zone, or have their time set to an earlier/later time intentionally (this is discovered as one of the testers had set their device's time later by 5 minutes on purpose) .

    -   Unable to send photos, videos and other types of media.

[Overall application]{.underline}

-   User Interface: 6

-   User Experience: 6

Date of user tests: 24/06/2022 - 25/06/2022

Overall, the feedback we obtained informed us that the features that we have implemented thus far are limited, and might not be able to provide an enjoyable user experience. Through user testing, we have discovered some limitations in our implemented features. We will thus focus on improving and refining these features further for Milestone 3, in order to create a product that is viable and pleasant to use.

For Milestone 3, we have conducted similar user tests but with more features this time.

The average rating for each feature with some feedback are as such:

[Main Features rating with feedback:]{.underline}

-   Profile Customization: 7

    -   Font used on buttons quite thin + orange colour makes it hard to read, maybe experiment with using the "Medium" versions of fonts to make it easier to read

    -   Placeholder texts like the one in the "About me" field should be set as actual placeholder values, not preset values in the bio

    -   Buttons and option bars not centralised, can have more options

    -   Can have more hobby options

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Swipe System: 8

    -   The animation can be quite quick to disappear which makes it easy to miss what action you performed if done accidentally.

-   Request Handling: 8

    -   Works well as intended

    -   Could use live notifications

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Messaging System: 8

    -   Faster loading would better

    -   Live notifications would be good

    -   Good that images can be sent

-   Filter System: 8

    -   Works as intended

    -   Unintuitive as default is all selected instead of all unselected

-   Feedback and report abusers system: 9

    -   Good to have confirmation that feedback was sent

    -   Works as intended, can have preset options for reasons

[Overall application with feedback]{.underline}

-   User Interface: 7

    -   Overall quite straightforward and has a pleasant to look at UI, aside from minor adjustments, very nice.

-   User Experience: 8

    -   Not very intuitive to setup profile after creating the account, might be better to perform profile setup while creating the account

    -   Have a toast for when user actions are performed so it signals to users that an action was done, otherwise, they might keep pressing the same button thinking it failed (especially when selecting preferences)

    -   But in general, easy to navigate and does not have too many overly complicated UI elements disrupting visual focus

Date of user tests: 24/07/2022 - 25/07/2022

# Software Engineering Principles

This section denotes the Software Engineering Principles that we have incorporated into our work over the course of Orbital.

## Version Control using Git:

We made use of branching to organize our respective work. Whenever we implemented a new feature (i.e. Firebase Backend or Adding a Home Page), we make sure to create a new branch that corresponds to that additional feature. This way, we ensure that the main branch is not affected whenever we add the feature.

![][48]

The branches within the red rectangle are active branches that we have created and worked on in the past.

## Pull Requests:

Before each member pushes their work onto the main branch, we made use of the pull requests feature on Git to ensure that both parties are well informed on the changes that have been made. After reviewing the code and testing on their own end, the other party will be the one to merge changes onto the main branch. This ensures that both members are on the same page.
