# Introduction

Hello! We are Alvin Jiang and Chen Guanzhou, developers of Close Contact, an android friend-finding app, and this is our readme, which also serves as a documentation to why and how we came to undertake this project. Throughout this document, you will understand why we believe our project is meaningful and the motivation behind it.

We will also elaborate on the features that we have decided to implement, providing a program flow to understand how our app is structured. After which, we detailed the various Software Engineering Principles we have adopted, followed by the project log to detail the time each of us have spent over the course of this project.

# Motivation

As students facing the challenges of interacting with others amidst the COVID-19 situation, we find it difficult to get to know others, and increase our social circle.

Many students find themselves craving social interaction with others, with high levels of loneliness reported in college students. An idea of a social networking app, made for students, can increase oneâ€™s exposure to others such that they can make more friends.


# Aim

We hope to create a social app that University students can make use of to find other students of the same course/hobbies/activities that they are keen on. Using a matchmaking system, we can allow students to swipe through the profiles of others, and chat with those they are interested in.

The app will serve to improve and enhance social interactions by providing a platform that allows for social interaction between students. This promotes more social activity within NUS students which has been painfully lacking, especially in recent years.

# User Stories

1.  As a student, I want to be able to customize my profile to include my course, hobbies, activities that I am looking to do with others.
2.  As a student, I want to be able to message other users on the app.
3.  As a student, I want to be able to look at the profiles of other users of the app, and swipe right or left depending on whether I am interested in interacting with them.
4.  As a student, I want to be able to see when others request to chat with me, and accept or decline accordingly.
5.  As a student, I want to be able to report others who abuse the platform, and send messages to the administrator.
6.  As an administrator, I want to be able to receive feedback from users regarding the platform and respond to messages sent by users.
