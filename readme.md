# Introduction

Hello! We are Alvin Jiang and Chen Guanzhou, developers of Close
Contact, an android friend-finding app.
# Motivation 

As students facing the challenges of interacting with others amidst the
COVID-19 situation, we find it difficult to get to know others, and
increase our social circle.

Many students find themselves craving social interaction with others,
with high levels of loneliness reported in college students[^1]. An idea
of a social networking app, made for students, can increase one's
exposure to others such that they can make more friends.

# Aim 

We hope to create a social app that University students can make use of
to find other students of the same course/hobbies/activities that they
are keen on. Using a matchmaking system, we can allow students to swipe
through the profiles of others, and chat with those they are interested
in.

The app will serve to improve and enhance social interactions by
providing a platform that allows for social interaction between
students. This promotes more social activity within NUS students which
has been painfully lacking, especially in recent years.

# User Stories

1.  As a student, I want to be able to customize my profile to include
    my course, hobbies, activities that I am looking to do with others.

2.  As a student, I want to be able to message other users on the app.

3.  As a student, I want to be able to look at the profiles of other
    users of the app, and swipe right or left depending on whether I am
    interested in interacting with them.

4.  As a student, I want to be able to see when others request to chat
    with me, and accept or decline accordingly.

5.  As a student, I want to be able to report others who abuse the
    platform, and send messages to the administrator.

6.  As an administrator, I want to be able to receive feedback from
    users regarding the platform and respond to messages sent by users.
